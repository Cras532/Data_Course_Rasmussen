I want to preform analysis on biology degrees. I want to find out the average pay across the U.S. for a Bachelors in Biology. 
From there, I would want to see how many bachelors continue to grad school and what they get paid for a Masters or Doctorates.
I can compare the cost of schooling with salaries and determine if the cost benefit is worth it. I will include matriculation
to medical schools as a variable.

I hope to see that as you increase your schooling (ie; bachelors to masters or doctorates) you will see a climb in salary.
